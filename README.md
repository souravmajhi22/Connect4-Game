# Connect4-Game
Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and
Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns 
dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, 
occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by 
playing the right moves.
